Dive into this 3D Zombie Shooter built in Rust — coded with ChatGPT-5! 🦀🧟‍♂️  In this project we use the macroquad game engine to spawn waves of zombies, shoot bullets, and track score, health, and waves in a fun arena-style survival game — all running locally on your own machine, with no server or cloud required.


🔥 What’s inside:

Written 100% using the Rust programming language. 

Runs entirely offline and local for full performance.

Simple 3D environment with cubes and spheres.

Waves of zombies that get faster and tougher.

Shooting, scoring, and game-over screen.

🙌 I encourage YOU to build your own zombie shooter (or any other game) in Rust. Push it further: add bosses, power-ups, or even multiplayer! Once you’ve tried it, let me know what you made down in the comments — I’d love to hear about it.
